# 🚚 Transport Management System (TMS)

This project was developed as part of a technical hiring task assigned by a reputed company. While working on this system, I gained hands-on experience in building scalable backend architectures, designing relational databases, implementing business logic, and documenting APIs in a structured manner.

The application focuses on managing transporters, trucks, bookings, and availability workflows through a well-designed Spring Boot backend.
